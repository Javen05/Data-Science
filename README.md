# Data-Science
Building supervised models to predict bicycle rentals for an hour and whether hit sales can be achieved, based on various environmental factors. The project also required me to build atleast 1 unsupervised model to understand the pattern of customers.

- Background
> After experiencing the lockdown and borders closure, restricting their movement, people have started to rediscover the beauty of their own local areas. This has resulted in a newfound appreciation for local places of interest, and people have been encouraged to explore their own backyards with public transport and find hidden gems they may not have otherwise discovered. One popular mode of transport is cycling. Ohaiyo Pte Ltd is a bicycle rental company in Japan seeking to expand their business such as purchasing more bicycles, have more outlets or hire more manpower. Such major decision needs to be backed up by data-driven evidence. Fortunately, Ohaiyo has collected data of past bicycle rentals. As a start, they would like to find out what are the factors that would affect the demands.

- Problem Statement:
> You are part of the Data Science team to engaged by Ohaiyo. Follow the steps of the Data Science Life Cycle to build predictive models to help Ohaiyo understand their customer behaviours and make recommendations to their business plans. 

- Task 1: Data Preparation
> Perform data cleaning, using at least one other complex technique, beyond deletion and simple imputation based on statistical estimates (i.e. mean, mode, median) to resolve the data quality issues presented in the attributes. Justify the approaches.
Perform two (2) data transformations of choice attributes, including but not limited to binning. Explain how the transformed attributes will help in the downstream analysis and/or modelling.
Select good features for Data Modelling by performing correlation analyses and also other statistical methods to analyse the relationships between nominal-nominal, ordinal-ordinal, interval/ratio-interval/ratio attributes. Support with explanation.

- Task 2: Data Understanding using EDA
> Plot and explain five (5) key takeaways (patterns, distributions, comparisons, categorisation, etc.) from your understanding of data and the attributes.
The take-aways come from bivariate and/or multivariate analysis.
Sequence your take-aways appropriately to highlight the intricacies, dependencies, or any other effects, such that the readers/stakeholders are able to appreciate the bicycle demand problem better.

- Task 3: Data Modelling
> Selecting appropriate targets, taking care not to include target leakages, to solve the problem statement with both regression and classification model.
Produce a leaderboard and justify the best performer for both regression problem and classification problem. This is done by tuning the parameters of the models.
Show evidence of model evaluation for the models listed in the leaderboard, including but not limited to underfitting and overfitting. The evaluation should go beyond the one-time data partitioning strategy.
Show the equation of the best performer for both regression and classification models, interpret what the equations show, and also explain the significance of the features in the equation.
Perform both k-means clustering and another clustering technique correctly to profile and identify the different clusters of rentals within the data. Explain how the identified clusters help to solve the problem statement. Justify why the clusters found are the best/ most appropriate.

- Task 4: Evaluations/Recommendations
> Suggest two (2) recommendations or business value prepositions for Ohaiyo Pte Ltd based on your analysis and modelling.
